Reckoning is a tab group based, sanity restoring extension for managing tabs in 
Chrome. It lets you set hotkey bindings to perform the collection of tabs in to
groups based on regular expressions, de-duplicate tabs, and kill tabs based on
regex.

More small features to come - current plans include making a given tab a
singleton, and garbage collection of "old" tabs based on last accessed date.

Install via chrome://extensions/ > Load unpacked and giving it the folder you
cloned to.
